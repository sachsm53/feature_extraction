# feature_extraction
Scripts for extracting visual and acoustic features from dynamic, naturalistic stimuli (movies/music/stories)

1) *musfeats.ipynb* - jupyter notebook for performing music information retrieval using librosa in python in sliding windows and converting extracted features into continuous regressors to predict neuroimaging data (see below) 

3) *aud_rms_check.ipynb* - jupyter notebook for predicting fMRI signal in the auditory cortex with acoustic features extracted from a continously-presented piece of music during fMRI  

5) *vis_feats.ipynb* - jupyter notebook for extracting visual features at each frame of a movie across specified layers of a deep neural network model (using on THINGSvision python toolbox)
